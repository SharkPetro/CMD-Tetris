# CMD-Tetris
Nothing more than coding practice, my first real C++ program.

If you want to play this, run in a console window 30 characters wide and 44 characters tall using point font with size 16x12 and increase scale (ctrl + scroll up) 4 times to make it 16x16. Only ever tested it on Windows, so there might not be a way to play on another OS with the same square character setup.

Archived, not planning to continue this project.
